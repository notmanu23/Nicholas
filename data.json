Python's `keyboard` library can help you detect when the space bar is pressed or released.\n\nThe actual audio recording can be done using the `sounddevice` library.\n\nHere's a small example:\n\n```python\nimport sounddevice as sd\nimport numpy as np\nimport keyboard\nfrom scipy.io.wavfile import write\n\nfs = 44100  # Sample rate\nseconds = 10  # Duration of recording\n\nprint('Press space to start recording.')\nwhile True:\n    if keyboard.is_pressed('space'):  # if space is pressed, start recording\n        print('Recording...')\n        myrecording = sd.rec(int(seconds * fs), samplerate=fs, channels=2)\n        sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished\n        print('Recording completed!')\n        write('output.wav', fs, myrecording)  # Save as WAV file \n        break\n```\n\nNote: Please be aware that you will need the `pyaudio`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `keyboard` libraries. You can install any of these libraries you don't have via pip: `pip install numpy scipy`\nsounddevice keyboard. Run the script with administrative privileges for the keyboard library to work properly.\n\nThis is a simple implementation and will start recording for 'seconds' duration immediately after detecting a space bar press. You might want to expand upon it to suit your specific needs.\n\nAlso, please note that recording audio without the consent of all parties involved could be considered illegal in some jurisdictions. Always ensure you have appropriate permission when recording any audio."
